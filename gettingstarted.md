# Support APIs: Getting Started 
## Overview
Cisco Support APIs are available only to Cisco Smart Net Total Care (SNTC) customers and Cisco Partner Support Services (PSS) partners and is gated by a role-based process that is administered by the customer or partner in the Cisco Services Access Manager tool. The remaining steps to gain access to the Cisco Support APIs depend on whether you are an SNTC customer or a PSS partner.
## Onboarding Process
To obtain access to the Cisco Support APIs you must assign someone from your organization as a Delegated Administrator. This individual is responsible for granting access to additional users and administrators within your organization. The process to onboard the Delegated Administrator depends on whether you are a Cisco Partner Service Support (PSS) partners or a Smart Net Total Care (SNTC) customer. Refer to the appropriate onboarding process below.
### PSS Partners
If you are a PSS partner, complete these steps:

1. Go to the [Cisco Partner Support Service Community](https://supportforums.cisco.com/community/5456/partner-support-service "Cisco Partner Support Service Community") page, and click the **API Access** link located under the Need Smart Support heading. Clicking this link opens an email form. 
2. Enter the requested information in the email form.

IMPORTANT! You must include a PSS contract number or your request cannot be processed.

Once the Cisco Smart Service Bureau verifies your information, they will open a case with the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) case on your behalf. The Cisco TAC engineer will then grant you access to both the Smart (PSS) API and the Support APIs. 
### SNTC Customers
If you are an SNTC customer, complete these steps:

1. Complete the instructions described in [Self-Service Onboarding](https://supportforums.cisco.com/blog/12600946/self-service-onboarding-register-get-access-smart-net-total-care-portal "Self-Service Onboarding").
2. Once you have a completed the self-service onboarding process, send an email to [SNTCSupportApiAccess@cisco.com](mailto:SNTCSupportApiAccess@cisco.com) to request access to the Cisco Support APIs. 

**IMPORTANT!** You must include the CCO ID of the individual assigned as the Delegated Administrator or your request cannot be processed.

**Note:** The onboarding process can take up to 48 hours after you submit the request for access to the Cisco Support APIs.
# Accessing the Cisco Support APIs
Once the onboarding process is complete, you can access the Cisco Support APIs using the [Cisco API Console](https://apiconsole.cisco.com/ "Cisco API Console"). For information on registering an application with individual Cisco Support APIs, refer to the Cisco API Console Platform Documentation.
